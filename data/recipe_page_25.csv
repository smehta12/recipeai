Drain.
Place the soaked and drained vaal ( lima beans ) in a damp cheese cloth and leave to sprout for 24 hours. Note that 12 hours is not enough to sprout. Ensure that there is a little bit of water at the bottom of the bowl so that the vaal will use it to sprout.
Add 1/4 cup water over the vaal and damp muslin cloth to ensure the lima beans sprout over the next 24 hours.
Tie the muslin cloth well and keep aside for 24 hours to enable sprouting. Our vaal ( butter beans, lima beans ) is now sprouted after 24 hours.
Put the sprouted vaal in a bowl full of water as we going to peel them.
