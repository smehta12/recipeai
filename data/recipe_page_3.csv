 1/2 cup cashew nuts (kaju)
 1/2 cup blanched almonds (badam)
 3/4 cup powdered sugar
 1/2 tsp cardamom (elaichi) powder
 1/2 tsp saffron (kesar) strands
 4 tsp unsalted butter
 1 tbsp milk","For kaju puri
To make 
kaju puri
, blend the cashewnuts in a mixer jar into a coarse powder. Keep aside.
Peel the blanched almonds one by one and dicard the skin. Spread them on a muslin cloth. Dab them very well with the same muslin cloth at least for 1 minute so as to remove all the excess moisture.
Blend these almonds too into a coarse powder similar to cashews.
Add the cashew powder, powdered sugar, cardamom powder and saffron strands to this jar containing almond powder and blend again till you get a fairly smooth powder this time.
To cook 
, combine 3 tsp of unsalted butter and 2 tbsp of water in a broad non-stick pan, mix well using a ladle till the butter melts completely.
Add the cashew-almond-sugar mixture to it, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 5 minutes or till the mixture becomes sticky, while stirring continuously.
Cook this mixture on a medium flame for 1 more minute or till the mixture turns like a ball, while stirring the mixture continuously.
Add the remaining 1 tsp of unsalted butter and mix well.
Immediately transfer the smooth mixture into a greased plate and spread it well. Keep aside to cool for 10 minutes until it is warm enough to work with. At this stage the mixture will turn slightly crumbly.
Add milk and knead into a dough.
Divide the dough of 
cashewnut puri
 into 2 equal portions.
Flatten one portion of the dough and place it on a greased rolling board and using a greased rolling pin roll it into a 7” diameter circle.
Cut out 4 circles with a 2½ inch cookie cutter or vati.
Remove them using a flat ladle and arrange them on a cookie sheet placed on a baking tray.
Gather up the scraps, knead, roll and repeat the process. You will get 15 circles in all.
Bake the cashew nut puri in a pre-heated oven at 200°c (400°f) for 5 minutes in the middle rack of the oven.
Remove the baking tray and cool them at room temperature for 2 to 3 minutes. This cooling step is important, otherwise the 
 will break while flipping.
Flip the 
kaju puris
 and again bake them at 200°c (400°f) for 5 minutes in the middle rack of the oven.
Transfer the 
kaju badam puri
