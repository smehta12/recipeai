Knead into a very stiff dough using enough water (not more than ¼ cup).

 into 2 equal portions.
Flatten one portion of the dough in between your palms. Keep the other portion covered with a dish or damp muslin cloth so that it doesn’t dry up.
Place the flattened portion on a greased rolling board and roll into a 250 mm. (10”) circle without using flour.
Make long cut along with 4 edges using a sharp knife so as to form a rectangle. Cut into long strips (approx. 16) using the sharp knife.
Heat the oil for deep-frying and a few 
 strips in it a few at a time. Note that you can heat the oil on a high to medium flame, but deep-fry only at a slow flame.
Deep fry on a slow flame till this indian diwali snack turns light brown in colour from both the sides.
