Knead the dough well using a little oil. Cover with a lid or a muslin cloth and keep it aside for 10 minutes. Ensure that you are using a wide mouthed bowl which helps in kneading the dough without creating a mess.
Divide the dough into 14 equal portions and shape them into round balls. Press them gently between your palms and flatten it to roll out each portion into a 125 mm. (5"") diameter circle using whole wheat flour for rolling.
Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) over medium flame. On the hot tawa, place the rolled circle and cook each circle, using a little oil, till it turns golden brown in colour from both sides on a slow flame.
To increase the shelf life of the thepla, use lots of oil while cooking; so that they will remain soft.
