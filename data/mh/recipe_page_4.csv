For making the ragda, soak the dried white peas and keep them overnight.
Drain the peas using a strainer and discard the water.
Put the soaked peas in a pressure cooker, add approximately 2½ cups of water and pressure cook for 6 whistles or until the peas are soft. It is very important for the peas to be soft for this stuffed ragda patties recipe to ensure it is properly enjoyed by all.
Allow all the steam to escape before opening the lid. This is called the natural release method and is done by removing the pressure cooker from the hot burner and let the pressure drop by cooling down naturally.
Now we have to prepare the tempering to which we will add the peas. For the, heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan, add the mustard seeds, curry leaves and asafoetida and saute for 30 seconds.
Add the potatoes, mix well and saute on a medium flame for 30 seconds.

Knead this mixture into a soft dough. Since the potatoes are very soft, its hard to give them a definite shape, that’s why we add cornflour the potatoes to ensure proper binding.
Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.
Take one portion and carefully flatten it between the palms of both your hands, making sure it does not break.
Place 2 tsp of the mint leaves and coriander mixture in the center of the flatten potato mixture.
Bring together the edges while lightly pressing the centre so that the filling does not fall out from the patty.
Completely seal the filling inside the potato and lightly press it again in between the palms of both hands to form a patty.
Repeat steps 5 to 8 to make 7 more patties.
Heat 1 tbsp oil on a tava (griddle).
Once the oil is hot, place the patties on the tava and let them cook on a medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes till golden brown on one side.
Turn the patties, drizzle with 1 tbsp of oil and let them cook on the other side on a medium flame for 2 minutes till golden brown.
