 1/2 tbsp besan (bengal gram flour)","For the dough
Combine all the ingredients in a deep bowl, mix well and knead into a semi-stiff dough using enough water.
Cover with a lid and keep aside.
For the masala
Heat a broad non-stick pan, add the dry coconut and dry roast on a medium flame for 1 minute or till the coconut turns light brown in colour. Remove it in a deep bowl and keep aside.
Add the sesame seeds into the same pan and dry roast on a medium flame for 1 minute or till it turns light brown in colour. Remove it in the bowl containing roasted dry coconut and keep aside.

Blend it in a mixer to a coarse powder.
Add the besan and mix well. Keep aside.
How to proceed
To make 
baked bhakarwadi
 divide the dough into 4 equal portions.
Divide the masala into 4 equal portions.
Roll a portion of the dough into 200 mm. (8”) diameter circle without using any flour for rolling.
Place a portion of the masala over it and pat it lightly while leaving a little space at the circumference. Gently roll over the masala evenly using a rolling pin, to ensure that the masala sticks well to the dough circle.
Spread a little water at the circumference of the dough circle which doesn’t have any masala.
Immediately start rolling very tightly from one end of the circle towards the other end to form a cylindrical roll while pinching the masala inwards simultaneously.
Gently press all over the cylindrical roll evenly so that the masala further sticks to the dough circle very well.
Trim a small portion from both the sides of the cylindrical roll and discard them.
Now cut it into 16 to 18 equal roundels using a knife and separate out each roundel very well.
Press each rolled bhakarwadi in a slanting manner using your palm.
Place them on a greased baking tray.
Repeat steps 3 to 11 to make more bhakarwadis.
Bake them in a pre-heated oven at 180°c (360°f) for 10 minutes, turn them over and bake again for 10 minutes.
Cool the 
 completely and serve or store in an air-tight container. Use as required.","Tags
