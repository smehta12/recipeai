Divide the dough into 5 equal portions.
Dust a rolling board with rice flour. Flatten the dough into a circular shape with your hands.
Using the palm of your hand press down gently  on the bhakri and roll it in a clockwise direction.
Roll with the palm of your hand till you get a 6 inch (150 mm ) circle. We need to increase the pressure a bit to increase the diameter of the bhakri.
Heat a non-stick tava (griddle). Place the rolled bhakri dough upside down on it. Cook for 30 seconds on medium heat. Sprinkle water on the top of the entire bhakri.
Flip over and cook the other side for 50 seconds. Remove bhakri from tava and cook on a high open flame using a chimta. The overcooked side of the bhakri becomes the top part of cooking on open flame.
Keep cooking and flipping till your bhakri is done.","Maharashtrian Rotis / Polis
