 6 1/2 cups full-fat milk
 1/2 cup sugar
 1/2 tsp cardamom (elaichi) powder
 2 tbsp chopped almonds (badam)
 2 tbsp chopped cashew nut (kaju)
 2 tbsp chopped pistachios
 1/8 tsp saffron (kesar) strands
 For The Garnish:
 2 tsp almond (badam) slivers
 2 tsp pistachio slivers
 a few saffron (kesar) strands","For basundi
To make the 
basundi recipe
, rinse a deep non-stick pan with ¼ cup of water and quickly simmer it for 1-2 minutes. This will prevent milk from scorching as the water forms a protective layer between the pan and milk.
Also, it is advisable to use a heavy bottom pan to make indian desserts like 
basundi
.
Now, add the full-fat milk in that deep non-stick pan and bring it to a boil on a high flame. This would take around 7-8 minutes. Stir it occasionally to avoid milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan or browning.
It is very important to use full-fat milk as it will provide the 
 a rich and creamy texture.
Reduce the flame and cook on a slow flame for 45-48 minutes while stirring and scraping the sides of the pan occasionally. It is always better to stay near the stove when the milk pot is on, to avoid cleaning up later. If you want a thicker consistency then simmer it for a little longer.
Add the sugar, saffron, almonds, cashew nuts, pistachios, mix well  and cook on a slow flame for approximately 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the sides of the pan.
If you forget to scrape the sides, the basundi will not become thick as the scraping of sides is what thickens the basundi. If you like it more sweet then you can add more sugar.
Add the cardamom powder and cook on a slow flame for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. You can even enhance the flavor by adding nutmeg powder.
Transfer this to a deep bowl and cool completely. Bring it to the room temperature.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and serve chilled garnished with almond, pistachio slivers and saffron. Refrigeration will thicken the consistency more.
Pour the 
 in a serving bowl and relish it hot with padvali roti and batata chips nu shaak for a satiating meal.
The grand gujarati thali is incomplete without mishtan like 
 along with rotli, shaak, dal/kadhi, farsan, chutney and kachumber.","Tags
