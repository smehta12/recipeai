 2 tsp ginger-green chilli paste
 1/4 tsp baking soda

 4 tsp sugar

 For the methi muthias:

 1 tsp ginger-green chilli paste
 3 tsp sugar

 1/2 tsp turmeric powder (haldi)
 a pinch of baking soda
 3 tbsp oil
 salt to taste
 For the tempering:
 1/4 tsp asafoetida (hing)
 4 tbsp oil","Main Procedure
For the methi muthias 
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and knead into a soft dough, adding water only if required.   
Divide this mixture into 30 portions and mould into oblong shapes by placing between the palms. Deep fry over a medium flame till the muthias are golden brown.  Drain and keep aside. 
How to proceed
Wash the papdi, add the carom seeds, soda bi-carb and salt and mix well. 
Make a criss-cross slit, at a right angle, in the potatoes and brinjals taking care not to separate the segments.  Keep aside.  
Cut the bananas into big pieces and cut a vertical slit in the centre of each piece. 
Fill the masala mixture into the slits of the potatoes, brinjals and bananas.  This will require about half the quantity. Keep the remaining half for later use. 
Heat the oil for the tempering in a pressure cooker and add the asafoetida and ginger-green chilli paste. 
Add the Surti papdi, purple yam, potatoes, sweet potatoes and brinjals and ½ cup of water and pressure cook for 2 whistles. 
Allow the steam to escape and open the pressure cooker. 
Transfer the cooked vegetables into a large pan and add the stuffed bananas, methi muthias and the remaining masala mixture. 
Cook on a slow flame till the bananas are tender, stirring occasionally.
