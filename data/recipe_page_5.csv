 1/2 cup chopped dried figs (anjeer)
 a few saffron (kesar) strands
 2 tbsp warm milk
 4 1/2 cups full-fat milk
 2 tbsp sugar
 1/4 tsp cardamom (elaichi) powder","Method
To make anjeer basundi, combine the saffron and warm milk in a small bowl, mix well and keep aside. Adding saffron strands imparts a great flavor and a hint of color to the anjeer basundi.
Combine the milk and sugar in a deep non-stick pan, mix well and bring to a boil on a high flame while stirring occasionally. This is should take approximately 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat and cook on a medium flame for 15 to 17 minutes, while stirring occasionally and while scrapping the sides of the pan. This step is essential to the anjeer basundi recipe because the malai stuck to the pan provides the thickness and consistency we desire.
Add the anjeer, saffron-milk mixture and cardamom powder, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally and scrapping the sides of the pan.
Cool the anjeer basundi completely, refrigerate for atleast 1 hour and serve chilled.","Jain

 1 1/4 cups buckwheat (kuttu or kutti no daro)
 1/2 cup sour curds (khatta dahi)
 1 tsp green chilli paste
 1/4 tsp ginger (adrak) paste
 salt to taste
 1/2 tsp fruit salt (optional)","For buckwheat dhoklas
To make 
buckwheat dhokla
, clean and wash the buckwheat in enough water only once. Washing it more will cause the starch to drain out.
Combine the buckwheat, curds and 1/3 cup of water in a deep bowl and mix well. Cover with a lid and keep aside to soak for at least 4 to 5 hours.
Add the green chilli paste, ginger paste and salt. Add 1/2 tsp fruit salt (optional). Let the bubbles form. Mix batter gently.
Pour half the batter into a greased 175 mm. (7"") diameter thali and spread evenly by rotating the thali clockwise.
Steam in a steamer for 10 to 12 minutes or till the dhoklas are cooked.
Repeat steps 5 and 6 to make 1 more thali.
Cool slightly, cut into pieces and serve 
 immediately.
Handy tip :
At step 3, allow the mixture to soak for at least 4 hours in summer season. In winter season the soaking time should be increased to 5 hours and if needed to 6 hours depending on the temperature. This will ensure soft dhoklas as the end result.","Gujarati Farsans
